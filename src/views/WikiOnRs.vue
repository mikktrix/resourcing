            Responsible sourcing practices are embedded in the wider
            sustainability agenda; they are a means to an end. Numerous
            approaches have been developed by industry and civil society to
            address RS challenges, across global value chains, ranging from
            employing safe and fair labour practices, protecting human rights,
            safeguarding financial integrity, mitigating impacts on the
            environment linked to operations, the social impact on communities
            and inter-related business practices, to name a few.

            Businesses, dependent on their size and location within global value
            chains, have different options to adopt, adapt, implement and report
            on their RS practices. With the multitude of management strategies,
            reporting standards, certification schemes and templates for the
            collection and sharing of information, implementing responsible
            sourcing can be a struggle for the well-intentioned firm.

          <v-col cols="12" class="text-h7 text-justify">
            Evolving from various strands of good corporate behaviour and
            external impacts of operations on not only first-tier but second and
            third tier stakeholders, responsible sourcing refers to a business’s
            ability to have a positive impact on the environment, social
            relations and economic systems. A firm’s operating and procurement
            choices have trade-offs and interlinkages, whose positive impacts
            need to be amplified and negative impacts need to be mitigated.
            Responsible Sourcing is an umbrella term that encapsulates these
            approaches, strategies and results.

          <v-col cols="12" class="text-h7 text-justify">
            Apart from commitments to a better world, business competitiveness
            is increasingly dependent on a firm’s sustainability credentials,
            and its responsible sourcing practices are part of earning those
            credentials. With an increase in Environmental Social and Governance
            (ESG) related investment indices, a firm’s ability to raise finance,
            attract new employees, access global value chains governed by RS
            principles, will be dependent on the business strategy it adopts for
            the future. It also reduces risk exposure, such as reputational and
            litigation risk.

          <v-col cols="12" class="text-h7 text-justify">
            A firm’s responsible souring obligations stems from a number of
            factors:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Law & other regulatory requirements:</strong> It must
                meet the legal and regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions
                it operates in.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Investors & Shareholders:</strong> Investors are
                increasingly linking RS (and sustainability) standards as a
                prerequisite of equity and debt financing. As a recipient of
                such finance, a firm is obliged to uphold RS standards endorsed
                by financial institutions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Permit & licensing conditions:</strong> A subset of
                regulatory standards, in order to receive and maintain permits
                and licences, a firm needs to meet the requirements set for
                these permits to remain valid.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Agreement terms & conditions:</strong> In some cases, a
                contract with the government, lead firm, supplier, developer or
                financier, will incorporates RS factors. Thus, RS obligations
                need to be met as part of contract fulfilment.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Commitments to stakeholders:</strong> Voluntary
                commitments, such as those made under a Social Licence to
                Operate, or commitments that do not take a legal form, but
                none-the-less are part of a firm’s corporate commitments to
                specific stakeholders, need to be upheld.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Voluntary/Corporate Commitments:</strong> Voluntary
                commitments at the firm level, either to international
                principles (such as the UN Human Rights Principles) or Industry
                Association Standards (such as the Automobile Association) apply
                at a more general level. These need to be respected as part of a
                firm’s corporate behaviour.

            A firm can consider a series of hierarchical steps in implementing
            RS.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Commitment:</strong> Acknowledging RS as a core
                operating procedure and committing to RS principles at the board
                level.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Strategy:</strong> Based on RS principles, designing
                business strategies that are suitable to the firm, under all
                major operations: production, procurement, human resources,
                finance, marketing, reporting and disposal.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Compliance:</strong> Implementing the RS strategy is
                often a key hurdle, as new vectors are introduced and
                incorporated within functioning systems. Compliance with
                objectives set under RS commitments and implementing the
                strategies to deliver on these objectives is a crucial stage for
                a business.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Auditing:</strong> Standardised reporting on RS
                practices and execution of third-party audits to provide
                information to employees, shareholders and the larger community,
                assists a business to report on its RS practices as well as

          </v-col>

          <v-col cols="12" class="text-h7 text-justify">
            Responsible Sourcing (RS) is a culmination of several economic,
            social and environmental factors and can be considered as a means to
            deliver on a sustainable growth and development agenda. Initially
            sustainability driven initiatives ledto the emergence of RS
            initiatives, setting out either voluntary or regulatory RS
            requirements. It is difficult to pinpoint how the need for RS
            emerged; safeguarding working conditions, protecting the environment
            and habitats and defending human rights etc have been around for
            centuries. Similarly, the emergence of advocacy for RS practices
            from civil society organisations, governments and international
            actors have an equally long history. However, over the past two
            decades, the impetus from a sustainability driven international
            agenda has incentivised a greater focus on RS practices, under one
            umbrella.
          </v-col>

          </v-col>

          <v-col cols="12" class="text-h7 text-justify">
            <p>
              While RS initiatives and practices have increased in number and
              scope, they are fragmented at this time. There are a myriad number
              of actors, initiatives and standards operating across the raw
              material sector focusing on sustainability and RS practices,
              standards and reporting mechanisms. This fragmentation of RS
              approaches, as well as inadequate and inconsistent measurement and
              reporting RS practices, are becoming a challenge in constructing a
              unified, internationally agreed definition of RS or an RS
              reporting mechanism.
            </p>

            <p>
              Primarily focusing on helping businesses adapt RS practices, the
              RE-SOURCING Project will use peer-learning, knowledge co-creation
              and stakeholder engagement to identify viable and competitive
              business practices and policy to assist wider uptake of RS
              practices by EU businesses.
